  float     32 bit   -3.4028235E+38 to 3.4028235E+38

Unsigned Data types (positive only)
  unsigned char   8 bit 0 to 255
  unsigned int   16 bit 0 to 65,535

These constants define the
operation of the digital pins as either INPUT or OUTPUT using the pinMode() function, or define the pin
levels as being HIGH or LOW

Arithmetic Operators:   +,   -,   *,   /
Compound Operators:     ++,   --,   +=,   -=,   *=,   /=


Order of Operations
  Symbol           Description                               Examples
  ( )              Parenthesis                               (x+y)*z
  ++ --            Increment, decrement                      x++, y--
  * / %            Multiplication, division, modulus         x * 1.5
  + -              Addition, subtraction                     y + 10
  < > <= >=        Less than, greater than comparisons       if (x < 255)
  == !=            Is, is not equal to                       if (x == HIGH)
  &&               Logical AND                               if (x == HIGH && x > y)
  ||               Logical OR                                if (x == HIGH || x > y)
  = += -= *= /=    Assignment and compound assignments       x = y


Comparative Operators
  Symbol   Description                 Is true ifâ€¦
  ==       is equal to                 the left side is equal to the right side
  !=       is not equal to             the left side is not equal to the right side
  <        less than                   the left side is less than the right side
  >        greater than                the left side is greater than the right side
  <=       less than or equal to       the left side is less than or equal to the right side
  >=       greater than or equal to    the left side is greater than or equal to the right side

Logical Operators
  Symbol   Description                 Is true ifâ€¦
  &&       logical AND                 both expressions are true
  ||       logical OR                  either expression is true
  !        logical NOT                 the expression is false

Integer Constants
  Base               Example    Formatter        Comment
  10 (decimal)           123    none

  2 (binary)        B1111011    leading 'B'      only works with 8 bit values (0 to 255)
                                                 characters 0-1 valid

  8 (octal)             0173    leading "0"      characters 0-7 valid       

  16 (hexadecimal)      0x7B    leading "0x"     characters 0-9, A-F, a-f valid
